# Sales Prediction using Python
This project focuses on predicting sales for a product based on various factors such as advertising spend, target audience segments, advertising platforms, and other relevant variables. Sales prediction is crucial for businesses to optimize their marketing strategies and budget allocations.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project typically includes historical sales data, advertising spend across different platforms, customer segments, and possibly additional factors affecting sales. You can find suitable datasets on platforms like Kaggle or other open data sources.

Installation
To run the project, ensure you have Python installed along with the following libraries:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn
You can use Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, or any IDE like VS Code.

# Appendix
import pandas as pd  # for data manipulation and analysis
import numpy as np   # for numerical operations
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt  # for plotting
import seaborn as sns  # for visualization
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split  # for splitting the dataset
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression  # for regression model
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, r2_score  # for evaluation metrics'
# Load the dataset
data = pd.read_csv('path_to_your_sales_dataset.csv')

# Display the first few rows of the dataset
print(data.head())
# 3. Data Exploration
Examine the structure and summary statistics of the dataset.

# Check the columns and data types
print(data.info())

# Get summary statistics
print(data.describe())

# Check for missing values
print(data.isnull().sum())
# 4. Data Cleaning
Handle missing values and prepare the data for analysis.

# Fill missing values or drop them
data.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)  # Example: forward fill

# Convert categorical variables to numeric using one-hot encoding if needed
data = pd.get_dummies(data, drop_first=True)
# 5. Feature Selection
Identify relevant features for predicting sales.

# Define features and target variable
X = data.drop('sales', axis=1)  # Assuming 'sales' is the target variable
y = data['sales']
# 6. Splitting the Data
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
# 7. Training the Model
Initialize and train a regression model, such as Linear Regression.

model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
# 8. Making Predictions

y_pred = model.predict(X_test)
# 9. Evaluating the Model
Assess the model's performance using evaluation metrics.


mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
r2 = r2_score(y_test, y_pred)

print(f'Mean Squared Error: {mse}')
print(f'R-squared: {r2}')
10. Visualizing Results
Visualize the predicted vs. actual sales.

plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.scatter(y_test, y_pred)
plt.plot([y.min(), y.max()], [y.min(), y.max()], '--r')
plt.xlabel('Actual Sales')
plt.ylabel('Predicted Sales')
plt.title('Actual vs Predicted Sales')
plt.show()
# Conclusion
Summarize the findings and insights from the analysis. Discuss potential improvements or future work, such as:

Exploring different models (e.g., Random Forest, XGBoost).
Fine-tuning hyperparameters.
Analyzing the impact of different advertising channels on sales.
